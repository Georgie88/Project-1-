Well after 911 in the U.S. all airlines are required to lock the cockpit during all flight operations to minimize another terrorist attack (many airlines require guns to be in the cockpit as well and the Captain to be regularly trained just in case...). So when they land and the door can be “unlocked” again the Hawaiian shirts go back in the brief cases and the uniform goes back on. Therefore, no one but the Captain or First Officer know about the good ol’ switcheroo. Most also don’t get caught because there’s an honor system where neither the Captain or First Officer ever talk about it with anyone or report each other since both were “not wearing professional attire” and both could equally lose their jobs over something yes, that silly. \n",

      "Many organisms thrive in acidic environments, or at the very least are able to survive in them. We frequently ingest organisms that could cause illness, but in small enough populations that, even if they survive, they can't get enough of a foothold in our bodies to actually cause symptoms of illness.

Listeria is a common cause of food born illness because the organism itself doesn't make us sick, rather it produces waste products that are poisonous to us.

      "Food poisoning may usually be caused by bacteria, but it's not a bacterial infection that makes us sick, it's the metabolic byproducts of that bacteria. Take botulism for instance; the bacteria create a poison as they multiply and it's the poison that makes us sick, not the bacteria. That poison ends up deposited in the food and so eating it is literally eating poison. And much the same way the stomach doesn't turn protein into carbon, it doesn't turn poison into carbon, it stays as poison. \n",

Living bacteria makes its way into the gut where it has to compete with the colonies already living there.

We benefit from this because gut fauna help us digest our food even better and get more nutrients from it than we would without it. \n",

      "Hi, I'm a second year microbiology student. Microbes are quite a cool bunch with lots of adaptations that make them able to colonise quite a broad spectrum of places. Whilst the stomach is highly acidic, which is generally good enough to kill most microbes that enter the gastrointestinal tract. There are some microbes, such as helicobacter pylori that are able to evade this acidity by secreting neutralising agents, along with burrowing into the stomach cells and hiding in a sense. Other times, the microbes actually don't survive, but their exotoxins (the things they secrete that make us sick or cause injury to our cells) are stable enough to survive their time in the stomach. They then pass through into the intestine where they can cause a range of diarrhoeal diseases. I can't think of any off the top of my head. But hopefully this is helpful.\n",

      "\n",
      "If I remember correctly, St. Martin had a fistula in his stomach, and Beaumont would drop food in to see what would happen. He noticed pores in the stomach wall lining secreting a liquid that would begin to break the the items down. He also took samples of St. Martin's gastric acid to break food down outside his stomach. Before this, it was thought that digestion was performed by the stomach squeezing and mashing food.\n",

If the infection is high enough, or the bacterium is resistant to acid, it will still grow. Iirc, salmonella will infect you if you get more than about 110 cells per gram of food. E coli can infect you with only a few cells! Some acid tolerant bacteria are beneficial or harmless, such as lactobacillus. So the amount of infection you eat, along with how dangerous the bacterium is matters.\n",

      "But there's another process at work, too, most notable with botulism and other bacteria and fungi (Aspergillus flavus, e.g.). **The bacteria doesn't need to be alive, and the byproducts are what's dangerous.** It's not an infection, but rather, the toxins they leave when they're alive.\n",

      "This is why cooking food that's gone bad is not proof against getting sick. It works for many things, but definitely not all.\n",
      "There are certain bacteria that are more easily destroyed by the stomach when its acid production is at full capacity.  Clostridium difficile is one, and people taking acid suppressors appear to be at greater risk of having C. diff colonize their gut, especially in a hospital setting.  \n",
      "Maybe this isn't what was being asked, but we often get sick from microbes, especially viruses such as influenza, that cause infections in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. The infection starts in your nose or throat before the microbe would even come in contact with stomach acid. The term \"stomach flu\" is a bit of a misnomer as a viral infection starting in the stomach wouldn't be caused by influenza, but could be from other viruses, which I think has been covered in prior responses.\n",
      "The bugs/chemicals that do end up making us sick are the ones capable of bypassing this acidic barrier. The few who are able to do so are able to make us sick by two main reasons; they irritate the stomach lining by attacking the cells that make it up, which leads to an immune system response in a part of the brain called the chemoreceptor trigger zone, causing nausea/vomiting to remove the toxins from the stomach.\n",
      "Chemist here. I wanted to point out something that I don't know if has been said. Not a big thing, just a detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stomach, even full of acid, cannot dissolve many things. Something is dissolved by acids if has alkaline character. For example, if you eat limestone (which is alkaline), the acid will break is quickly. But if you eat glass, which is acidic, the acid won’t do anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the amide bonds in proteins can be attacked by acids, but only slowly. That's why the body uses enzymes to speed things up. But it can happen that many toxic compounds have acidic character and won't be affected by the acid, and some bacteria might have protective compounds on the cell surface that don't react with acids, working as a barrier.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is another reason why getting sick can happen. Everything everybody else said is also true. But this is a reason why, for example, hydrogen cyanide can hurt you (is an acid, son the acid in the stomach won't destroy it). In fact, you usually eat the salt, sodium/potassium cyanide. And it is when it founds the acid in the stomach it gets converted to the poisonous hydrogen cyanide. So in that example the stomach acid is part of its toxicity.\n",
      "Two main reasons stand out for me. The first is that many of the bacterial/microbial molecules which make us sick are glycosylated (decorated with sugars) which make sensitive areas resistant to acidic and enzymatic breakdown. The second example is that H. pylori which resides in your stomach takes advantage of the gradient of acidity in your stomach. The lumen (open area further from the lining in contact with food) is most acidic (though not always! Depending on what you eat/drink, the pH of your stomach can be pH 6, or slightly acidic) followed by a gradient of acidity through the protective mucus lining, finally reaching pH 7 (neutral) at the cell lining. So H. pylori will attach to epithelial cells at pH 7, and will sense when the cells have been released into the lumen by sensing the pH, letting go and swimming back toward the pH 7 environment.\n",
      "Things don't get \"destroyed\" by your stomach acid. It merely gets broken down to the collection of molecules that will then be absorbed by your body (or excreted). That being said, things that poison you usually do so because they have a detrimental effect on your body (often, primarily on the liver or brain). These things will typically still be absorbed and, once they are, you become ill. I am speaking in terms of man-made poisons, by the way. Microorganisms and viruses are a whole different story.\n",
      "So just to make sure your food is safely digested before reaching your intestines, is there a specific eating order to risky foods? Like should I eat my chicken before my potatoes? just to make sure it get's thoroughly digested? or would eating smaller amounts of food result in a lower chance of dangerous bacteria reaching my intestines?\n",
      "Can I add a question to OP?\n",
      "\n",
      "Can someone talk about the relationship between chewing and digestion?\n",
      "\n",
      "Will I digest more efficiently and have better nutrient uptake if I chew thoroughly? Or does it depend on how much I eat e.g. thorough chewing important if stuffing my face, but not so much if only a small meal? \n",
      "\n",
      "I've heard the stomach empties within about 2 hours or something, so is there kind of a maximum volume of food that it can properly break up in that time which may or may not be modulated by how much I chew? And so if I over-eat on that metric, I just won't be able to fully or efficiently absorb all of the nutrition from that food?\n",

      "A lot of the bugs that make you sick are in the form of cysts when ingested, then they hatch in your intestines.  Giardia does this, as an example, which is why symptoms can take some time to appear. \n",
      "Because we don't just get sick from the micro-organisms, we also get sick from the toxins that the bacteria/viruses produce. Those toxins will linger on even if the bacteria is killed. This is why food that has been left out too long can still make you sick even if you heat it up enough to kill bacteria in it.\n",
      "Certain bacteria, such as H. pylori (known to cause stomach ulcers and cancer), actually have enzymes capable of making the micro environment around them more basic through production of ammonia. Pretty fucking cool.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. Sheer quantity. A LOT of cells can live in a tainted piece of food, and total eradication in the time food stays in the stomach becomes less likely the larger the population is. Nature works on this \"spray and pray\" method pretty regularly. Especially at the cellular level. \n",
      "Bacteria waste (from spoiled food) is toxic regardless, acid just kills the bacteria from making more of the toxic waste.\n",
      "While your stomach oh is generally low enough for bacteria not to grow, they can still survive at their current concentation. Acid majority acts as a growth inhibitor rather than a killer.  There are three types microbes in the manor of how they make you sick: they either poison you before hand by living in food, irritate you by inhabiting you,  or poison you while inhabiting you.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Let me know if you want further detail as I would need to look at a reference.\n",
      "There are also a lot of bacteria that produce toxins that make us sick, and for those, the bacteria no longer need to be alive for preformed toxin to have an effect (c. diff)\n",
      "Stomach acid isnt active unless the enzyme (pepsin) activates the pepsinogen. The Hydrochloric acid that is secreted from our parietal cells isnt activated as a strong acid until that happens. So it isnt always burning our lumen \n",
      "Because our stomachs are also made to absorb what's put into them, but vomit out toxins or expel them through defecation. \n",
      "It does kill most Microbes, but some have evolved to be both resistant to the acidity of our stomach AND virulent, e.g. E. coli 0157:H7.

Although I saw most of the \"movie\" through the lens of an imaginary camera, I actually embodied Jet Li for some of the major fight scenes.  The last \"average bad guy\" Jet Li fought was a giant muscular dude who looked like Sagat from Street Fighter, only he was black.  After defeating him, for some reason the clouds disappeared, and the mystery object in the sky was revealed to be an opulent flying palace.  A squad of F-15 fighter jets scrambled out of the floating palace, making it suddenly clear that George W Bush and Dick Cheney were the bad guys in the floating palace, planning some sort of coupe which would make them divine Emperor-like figures.  If memory serves me correctly, George W Bush was verbally belittled by Dick Cheney and removed from the plot after Jet Li got to the palace, but the final fight scene made up for it, as Dick Cheney had a \"power pole\" just like the one Goku has in Dragon Ball and he knew how to use it.

An example of this is the Laraway Elementary School incident in Illinois – with over 150 children sickened from ammonia contaminated chicken tenders in the school lunch.

      "Oh, I have a food poisoning story! Traveled to Las Vegas for business and my husband flew out a couple days later for a long weekend vacation. Stayed at the Venetian, had a good time but I was ready to go home. I'm not a great traveler, I like my home. Our flight was at 7 AM Monday, the day after the super bowl. Wake up at 4:30 AM Monday, head to the airport, check our bags, get through security and out of nowhere all the hair on my body is standing on end. Not feeling so great. Hit the bathroom, didn't help. Hit it like 3 more times, I'm just getting worse and about to get on a 5 hour flight. Not good. Not good at all. There's just no way I'm able to do this. I leave my husband so he can get home to our kids and I head back to the Venetian and book another room. I laid there for 36 hours, sick, shivering, sweating, hallucinating, it was terrible. I had no clothes because all my stuff was in my checked bag. I drank everything in my mini bar that was not alcohol to counter the eminent dehydration. I eventually had to venture out to get more beverages, some sort of light food and something else to wear since the clothes on my back were slept in and sweated up. People were really staring at me as I was literally staggering around sick, exhausted, sweaty and dehydrated. I'm sure people thought I had partied too much, but I hadn't had anything alcoholic to drink while in Vegas. Finally after about 36 hours, I was able to hold myself together for any length of time, I booked a fight the hell out of there the following evening. Haven't been back to LV since. Lesson learned, my husband should have stayed with me. Although everything worked out ok, I shouldn't have been out there that sick alone. Some people just can't handle Vegas.\n",

I was downing water like a champ all day just so i didnt die, by 8 in the evening i felt like death was knockin on my front door, so i went to the urgent care, i had no insurance, so i had to pay a doctor 200 dollars to take a three inch needle and jab me in my ass cheek with some anti-nausea medicine, the whole time they kept saying dont tense up, but thats kind of hard to do as your being injected in the ass cheek, then they said i could wait for a few minutes if i need to, i didnt feel any different, but when i was at the pay window, i pretty much decided their counter wqs a good place to lay down and take a nap. That was a long day.\n",

I should've been hospitalized, but I was living with my now ex-boyfriend and that was when I learned he didn't give a fuck about my well-being.  I moved back in with my parents a week later.  I was working as the calf feeder on his family's dairy farm because their calf feeder suddenly quit.  I got sick from the calves, and my shit-head boyfriend made me work while I was sick.  Not during the first week (though he tried his hardest to make me feel guilty about it) because I literally couldn't move and I was pooping every 10 minutes, but during the second week when I still could barely eat, was nauseous all the time, and still had crazy diarrhea.

      "Brother, I know your pain.  About 5 years ago I was visiting a friend in Seattle, went to a bunch of awesome restaurants and saw the Pike Place Food Market.  Hours before my flight from Seattle to Buffalo, NY I was feeling very very ill.  I was tossing up Bile and all kinds of terrible things.  I busted a blood vessel in my eye throwing up as much as I did, but I needed to get home because I was catering a wedding a few days later and didnt have the funds to change flights either.  So I got on that plane and felt like I was going to die the entire 14ish hours.  Almost wasnt allowed back on the connecting flight from Detroit to Buffalo.  A woman sitting next to me on the flight thought I was going to die then and there...worst experience of my life.\n",
      "That's the good kind of food poisoning. I apparently had a case of food poisoning, but had no idea at the time. I thought I was dying. My abdomen was in so much indescribable pain, I would just shriek in pain every minute or so. I was bloating up and unable to use the bathroom at all. Breathing was horrendously painful. I've given birth and had a c-section. Neither could even compare to this pain. I finally got to the doctor's office (driving like I was drunk). I sat in the waiting room for less that 2 minutes, because my shrieking was freaking out the other patients. I honestly thought the doctor was going to send me to the hospital. No, she says it's really bad food poisoning. So bad she prescribes me vicodin. And tells me if I haven't used the bathroom in 4 hours, get to the ER immediately. So then I have to wait in line at the pharmacy. I'm standing there, shaking and sweating and in so much pain. The 5 people in front of me let me go ahead of them and look at me like I'm patient zero. I have never in my life gotten prescription narcotics from a pharmacy in less than an hour. Took them 15 minutes. After I took the vicodin and could relax, things slowly got better. The source of all this pain? The only thing I had eaten was a wendy's grilled chicken sandwich. To be fair, I think at this time there was some contaminated lettuce or something. The other kind of food poisoning is not fun either, but anything would be better than the experience I had.\n",

It was a slow day, and I guess the woman behind the counter had the same orange chicken out all day or something. I did not enjoy having food poisoning to say the least, and I hope that cunt got hit by a car and killed and her family couldn't afford her funeral and died from preventable diseases because they couldn't afford health insurance from the debt she piled on them from her death.

She spent the next month in the hospital, so we (her kids) spent every single day there in turns so she wouldn't be alone, and she died on Christmas.  I don't remember anything from that year.  I know my young kids had a tree, stockings and presents, but I don't remember any of it.  I must have done it all on auto-pilot.  One might think I would hate the holidays, but I love them even more and put even more effort into them.  My mom loved them too.\n",

      "Six or seven rounds later everyone was so drunk that they cried. I was also allotted quite a few sips so for a very naïve fourteen-year-old I was pretty drunk. They decided that I was the most sober out of everyone there (and I'm pretty sure I was) so they made me drive them all back to my aunt's house. I basically learned to drive right then. Keep in mind the 'car' was my aunt's house-sized SUV that went from 0 to 60 in maybe two hours. I had no idea what the fuck I was doing but somehow I got everyone home.\n",

      "\n",
      "Welp, not *that* year.  We came into the dining room to the usual spread of Turkey, sweet potatoes, stuffing, ham, mushroom gravy, and so on.  Only nothing had been cooked.  Nothing.  The turkey was stuffed, but it was merely defrosted.  The ham was cold, as it hadn't been cooked at all.  The \"gravy\" was more like mushroom and butter floating in water.

      "So you'd think, hey, drinking some water is a good idea. Nope- I couldn't process it at all. I would drink water because I could not mentally help it- my body was demanding it and it was the only thing I could think of. I'm not sure I've ever felt so dehydrated in my life.  The water would just come back up into the toilet, and I was left in agony on the bathroom floor. I tried to go to my room a few times to sleep but it didn't help. My parents were doctors and I guess knew the norovirus when they saw it, and so they refused to take me to the hospital, but I would have done anything for an IV. I was finally able to eat about 30 hours after it started, when my Dad gave me some jello.\n",

      "I moved to Texas about 11 years ago, leaving most of my family in Florida.  Since I didn't want to spend Thanksgiving alone, a friend and I rented a car and drove back together - I dropped her off in Orlando then continued south to see my family.  When I got there it was a disaster; it seemed like the entire family was pissed off at each other.  Person A refused to be in the same place as person B and person C didn't want to see Person A and so forth, so the family was having like 3 different Thanksgiving gatherings.  Of course this means that there is no way for me to win, because no matter which one I go to someone is going to get upset that I didn't go to THEIR dinner.\n",

We were living with my grandpa at the time, it was late and I heard him calling from downstairs. He usually came partway up the stairs, even though he had a hard time doing so, before he called up to us for anything so I should have realised that something was wrong based on the distance he was yelling from. I went downstairs and he was in his living room recliner like usual, but had to ask me to help him to the kitchen table which I had never had to do before. I had to hold him over my shoulder, but we made it to the kitchen and got him seated in his favorite chair. I wish I remembered more than that, but I'm sure I went upstairs and continued about my life as usual. The next morning I just remember my mom coming into my room crying. Grandpa had died in his sleep. I couldn't even work up the courage to say goodbye before the coroners took his body away.

It was very nice but then on the 26th my uncle made a confession; my father, aunt and uncle’s half-sister no one else knew about wanted to meet everyone. My grandfather had had an affair and a love child that he decided to abandon almost entirely. As an adult she sought out her siblings and even her father (who denied to see her). My father and aunt have extremely common names so they were no use but my uncle's name (Kipfer) yielded actual results. The biggest problems with this confession: My grandfather had died before I was even born. My grandmother found out her late husband cheated on her and fathered a child she never knew about (and then learned about it from her son) and probably worst of all, my uncle had waited 5 years to tell us this. (During those five years there was a span of over 2 months where he lived with us). We fought all the way over to her house (which was in driving distance) but as soon as we met her she was welcomed and gladly accepted into the family.

He became very withdrawn after, as if he was just waiting to die - which he was, I guess. All enjoyment and reason for living seemed to just drain from him.

Reduce the risk by using good fridge door policy to minimize the temperature fluctuations in your icebox. Keep a deep freeze for longer term freeze storage so it doesn't thaw and refreeze. Know how to defrost-leaving meat on the counter or runnning it under warm water are definitely not good ideas. Refrigerate or freeze leftovers promptly and use the same protocol as above from there. And reheat food all the way through, bringing liquids to boiling if possible. Don't let your snacks and appetizers sit out uncovered and unrefrigerated for hours, either. \n",

Even though I myself had not done the deed, I felt like a dog which had shat in the house, but ten thousand times worse, and magnified even more so by my epic hangover and the guilt stemming from the fact that this drunken debauchery had taken place while my little nieces and nephews were only steps away, and in the bathroom and hallway which they used.  I can only imagine how my friend felt, as he had been blackout the entire time and was shown the extent of his actions in the harsh light of morning.  After about 20 minutes of shouted disbelief by my family and several clumsy attempts at cleaning the devastation, Rob gives my parents money to hire a cleaner and I drive him home.

      "First humans (*Homo sapiens sapiens*) speciated some 200,000 years ago. Evidence for fire and cooked food precedes this date, somewhere in our *Homo* lineage. Physical evidence for fire dates back many hundreds of thousands of years, morphological evidence (changes within ourselves) go back further.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Physical Evidence**: \"In Montreal, Canada in March 2004 stated that there is evidence for controlled fires in excavations in northern Israel from about 690,000 to 790,000 years ago. A site called Terra Amata, seems to have been occupied by H. erectus; it contains the earliest evidence of controlled fire, dated at around 300,000 years BC. Despite these examples, some scholars continue to assert that the controlled use of fire was not typical of *H. erectus*, but only of later species of *Homo*, such as *H. heidelbergensis, H. sapiens neanderthalensis, and H. sapiens sapiens*).\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Morphological Evidence**: The *Homo* lineage appeared about 2.4 mya with *Homo habilis*. Before the control of fire - we weren't humans (*homo sapiens sapiens*), we were another *Homo* species. Some scientists argue that even the earliest members of the *Homo* lineage used controlled fire to cook food, Homo erectus at around 1.8 mya. They justify this with changes in morphology resulting from this cooked diet - shorter guts and changes in dentition to name a few. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, anotomically modern humans have always had the ability to control fire, and cook food. As we progress through the Homo line - fire and cooking developed to be more complex/widespread leading to an even greater varied foraging and extracting diet.  We do know that the diet was mostly cooked plants (tubers, fruits...) and that a smaller portion of the diet was made up of cooked meat. But that as hunting techniques and tools became more refined, meat increased in proportion. Thus fire having been used to modify our food also in turn effected our internal gut morphology. This probably affected our ability to deal with parasites - cooking food does that for us - so digestive system no longer had to \"solve\" that problem. It could direct energy elsewhere.\n",

      "**In terms of the effects of raw meat and food poisoning...**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Food poisoning is usually caused by viruses or bacteria - like E. Coli - and this is not restricted to raw meat. Often it can be infected raw veggies that cause food poisoning. Another problem with eating raw meat would be getting a parasite from it. Parasites are different from bacteria. Parasites tend to act over a longer time period and can cause long-term damage. Many people have parasites, usually in places where sanitation is poor but for the most part survive fine with them so long as they are healthy. If unhealthy individuals or malnourished individuals get parasites it can cause a lot of damage or death. If you got a parasite from eating raw meat there are ways to treat it. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Carnivores and other animals do suffer from parasites and related diseases from eating bad food (meat and plants). Humans do suffer from the same problems if we eat bad food. Our internal gut morphology - for instance our stomach acid - cannot cope with every parasite or bacteria. Carnivores are better able to cope with these, because their digestive system is adapted to a carnivorous diet - however they are not 100% immune to the effects of bad meat or infected meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. As mentioned by others, carnivores tend to eat freshly killed animals. Fresh animals don't tend to be infected with bacteria and viruses - parasites are another issue. Meat, in any stage can be infected with parasites - different parts of the body are targeted by different parasites. Moreover, animals that we eat are often kept in  dense population levels (this increases the chance of disease) and after our animals are killed they are put through many processing and packaging steps. All of this handling and processing increases the chances of contamination and/or cross-contamination. That is why you should always cook meat, more often then not its safe but the consequences of eating bad food (meat and plants) can be very bad. Its important to exercise caution - but no need to go overboard either.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Even raw fish can contain parasites and other \"baddies\" - if you eat raw anything you are putting yourself at risk (although that risk may be very small).\n",
      "\n",
      "[removed]\n",
      "Carnivores can get parasites, too.  Actually, fish get all kinds of parasites;  you can too if they aren't immediately frozen after being caught.\n",
      "edit: and you eat them raw\n",
      "Ahh, but you are capable of eating and digesting raw meat.  It'll take a bit longer to digest than cooked meat, and won't be as tasty, but there's nothing about it that your digestive tract cannot handle.  Your ancestors ate plenty of raw meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are warned against eating raw meat because where meat it processed can be a haven for bacteria.  Slaughterhouses and processing plants go to great lengths to sanitize themselves, but whenever meat is sitting around for extended periods of time, in transit or whatever, bacteria in and on the meat have a chance to multiply.\n",
      "It's not about the raw meat as it is about contamination. The carnivore doesn't worry about packing, handling and sending his food across the country. He just eats it right there, not really much time for contamination, I guess.\n",
      "I have fed an all raw meat/bone/organ diet to my dogs for 2 years now without a single instance of bacterial infection. From what I understand, a carnivore's digestive tract is extremely short as compared to herbivores and even omnivores. Bacteria thrives on being able to settle in and reproduce, but the small length of a carnivore's intestine doesn't give it much of a chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have heard of dogs getting bacterial infections from commercial meat, but only when it's \"past it's prime\". But even \"fresh\" commercial meat isn't that fresh in my opinion, so we feed within a day of thawing.\n",
      "We can eat raw meat. The issue is the meat you get in supermarkets is not fresh off the kill, so to speak. It has been handled and picked up bacteria from multiple sources. \n",
      "This is not true.  Humans can eat many different types of raw meats.  Examples are horse, cow, fish, chicken, and just about everything else you would typically never eat that way.  In Japan these are common \"sashimi\" dishes.  The problem is that under the conditions of most modern farms, the animals are exposed to conditions that weaken their immune systems and allow for the widespread development of bacteria.  Under humane and proper farming conditions, those problems do not exist.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The issue is primarily related to how the animals live and are treated more so than humankind's ability to survive the typical bacterial living on those animals.\n",
      "Like many have already said, it's more about the bacteria and all that on the meat and what I learned, it's more of spreading bacteria and all that from raw meat to cooked meat were they would thrive and spread rapidly.\n",
      "You can eat raw food, I love raw beef, pork, fish - it takes a couple years of salmonella (which I got anyway when I was younger from handling amphibians and reptiles frequently) - but as long as the raw meat doesn't have worms in it your good (after your gut bacteria adapt).\n",
      "This seems like a mis-asked question to me. Food poisoning generally refers ingestion of bacteria that have grown on raw meat left exposed or contaminated. Where most carnivores will be eating the meat fresh from a kill, generally speaking. No time for the bacteria to reproduce. \n",
      "You can eat any meat raw! the difference is that predators are eating raw meat from animals that died only a few minutes ago. Other than a handful of parasites, if you kill and immediately butcher and eat an animal you are not going to catch something. \n",
      "Not quite true. I have eaten raw meat and had nothing go wrong.\n",
      "The distinction is if there are any active pathogens in your meat, the cooking will kill them.  If you eat raw meat that's clean, no problem.  Cooked meat is easier to chew and digest than raw meat.\n",
      "What about diseases such as salmonella?  For the most part, humans can eat raw red meat, but poultry and pork need to be cooked all the way (or most of the way) through. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We can eat raw meat, provided that the meat is not riddled by parasites to begin with. If you kill an animal without opening the flesh, and then cut open the muscles without exposing them to bacteria then the muscle tissue would be safe to eat. \n",
      "\n",
      "Living in Korea I ate my share of \"Yukweipipimpop\" which is Korean for raw beef and rice and spices. I have also enjoyed freshly chopped octopus dipped in special spices still writhing on the end of the chopsticks. Traditional raw foods including sushi, if prepared properly, can be eaten with minimum risk of parasites -- but that risk remains. It is best to cook meat if one wants to avoid tapeworms, for example. That said, humans can digest meat eaten raw, especially if it is rotten and soaked for a long time in brine. Aged, rancid meat was always the meat of no choice before refrigeration. \n",
      "Most of the bacterial load in an animal is probably concentrated in the areas exposed to the outside: gut, respiratory tract, skin, reproductive tract. [The Human Microbiome Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Microbiome_Project) is focusing on these areas, probably because everywhere else isn't worth studying in terms of micro flora.\n",

      "they have stronger stomach acids to break meat down rapidly and much shorter intestines to get the meat out, according to Cancer Research Magazine meat taking too long to pass through our systems is the leading cause of colon cancer. dont know if this has to do with food poisoning but it does make humans sick. \n",
      "Humans can eat raw meat with no problems. Food poisoning occurs when bacteria develops, this takes time (hours/days). Most carnivores kill and eat their prey within minutes, so this is not an issue. I'm sure if a Lion ate days old meat, he would get sick. Food poisoning is a result of improper storage, preparation or contamination of food and has nothing to do with eating raw meat. The reason it's not a good idea to eat raw ground beef from the supermarket is because the meat is processed in machines that can never be 100% clean and from random cuts of meat that could have been exposed to the air for hours, enough time to develop bacteria, you need to cook it through to be safe. Fresh and properly prepared meat can be eaten raw and is probably more healthy for you.\n",

      "Harvard evolutionary biologist Richard Wrangham argues that the invention of cooked food was the watershed event that led to the rapid development that differentiated us from the other species.  Cooked food is easier to digest and provides more nutrition.  Our bodies evolved to accommodate a diet of cooked food, which is why, compared to other animals, we have a very small mouth and gut relative to our body size.  We are the ape that cooks.\n",

      "I figure this is worth being put into discussion. Has anyone else read People of the Deer (Mowat)? In the novel he writes vividly about the Ihalmiut people killing a barren-ground caribou and immediately cutting it up and eating it raw. Mowat also goes on in length about how these caribous are riddled with worms and other parasites while living but it never seems to affect these people negatively when they eat them raw. It's my understanding that these people were kind of an in between the Inuit and Cree nations, living inland near the tree line, almost entirely subsisting off of caribou. Now I know Mowat's been greatly questioned for his authenticity/truthfulness, but it's worth noting that there are accounts of modern humans subsisting off of raw meat.

      "The current conditions of raising animals for meat in our society is probably the greatest reason why we are not able to eat raw meat without getting sick.  Cows, Pigs, Chickens, and Turkeys are raised in [CAFO's]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_Animal_Feeding_Operations)(Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations) where you have animals confined in a small space wallowing in their own excrement for months before they are slaughtered.  Which exposes them to many forms of bacteria that are harmful to us.  Another problem with [feed lots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_feeding) and CAFO's, at least for cows, is the feed that they are given.  When cows are given a diet of mostly grain, soy, and other ingredients, such as antibiotics and growth hormones, the PH in their gut is thrown off balance greatly.  Cows are Ruminants which means that their digestive system is meant primarily to digest forage (grass, legumes, and silage).  When you introduce grains to that system it doesn't work properly.  [E-coli 0147:H7](http://ezinearticles.com/?Top-2-Things-the-Commercial-Beef-Industry-Does-Not-Want-You-to-Know!&id=2227345) has become a real problem in the beef industry, and since cattle are fed antibiotics during their stay in the CAFO this particular strain of E-coli has become antibiotic resistant.  Making it very difficult to get rid of in humans.  So to surmise CAFO beef is bad for you and Grass fed beef is good for you.  [Here](http://www.eatwild.com/healthbenefits.htm) is some information to support that.  As far as chicken goes Salmonella is caused by mice getting into the chicken feed and defecating in their feed.  The chickens then eat the feed, mouse droppings and all, and then become infected with salmonella.  On a small scale operation the farmers have much more control over what goes into their chicken's feed, although it is very difficult to keep mice out of any animal raising operation.  Hope this helps, some further reading that you may be interested in is Real Food, by Nina Planck and Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, by Barbara Kingsolver.  Both of those books give a lot of information on just what kind of importance food has in the health of our bodies. One more thought about eating raw meat.  The cooking process of many things, meat and vegetables, actually destroys many necessary nutrients that are present in them.  It is actually better for you to eat food raw than to cook it. [Here](http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FPNS%2FPNS4_02%2FS0029665146000321a.pdf&code=666d4d603115b30f0e7fa9d615b280fd) is some more information helping my claim.\n",
      "You can eat raw meat but since you never do you don't have the guy bacteria to deal with it very well. Even then, we aren't adapted to eat a lot of raw meat. We have had fire for hundreds of thousands of years for cooking. If you eat raw meat for most of your life since you were young or if you slowly introduce raw meat to your diet you can eat raw meat too. The biggest reason we cook most all of our meat thoroughly now is do to how long our meat sits around before we eat it a long time and can easily be contaminated by places that process meat all day every day and gives bacteria time to spread and grow. I would not recommend eating store bought meat raw ever due to that. If you however kill something and just close to immediately start eating it you won't get sick from it though.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR You can eat raw meat if you really want to. I just don't recommend it unless you just killed the animal though.\n",
