Now you may be asking, how in the world do they pull this off? Well after 911 in the U.S. all airlines are required to lock the cockpit during all flight operations to minimize another terrorist attack (many airlines require guns to be in the cockpit as well and the Captain to be regularly trained just in case...). So when they land and the door can be “unlocked” again the Hawaiian shirts go back in the brief cases and the uniform goes back on. Therefore, no one but the Captain or First Officer know about the good ol’ switcheroo. Most also don’t get caught because there’s an honor system where neither the Captain or First Officer ever talk about it with anyone or report each other since both were “not wearing professional attire” and both could equally lose their jobs over something yes, that silly. \n",

      "Many organisms thrive in acidic environments, or at the very least are able to survive in them. We frequently ingest organisms that could cause illness, but in small enough populations that, even if they survive, they can't get enough of a foothold in our bodies to actually cause symptoms of illness. When a large enough population is introduced all at once, there's not a lot your stomach acids will do for you, and some organisms will actually grow faster in a highly acidic environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of that, not all food-born illnesses are caused by living organisms. Listeria is a common cause of food born illness because the organism itself doesn't make us sick, rather it produces waste products that are poisonous to us. If a large enough population of Listeria is allowed to breed in food that is then cooked, the organisms themselves will die during cooking, but the toxic waste byproducts they created don't actually break down when cooked.\n",

      "Your stomach acid isn't very strong (or more properly, concentrated), in the scheme of things. Much of the work is done by enzymes, in conjunction with the acid. Furthermore, the acid is produced as needed. You don't walk around with half a litre of concentrated acid sloshing around.\n",
      "\n",
      "The acid is produced by special cells. Some people, like me, have over active ones. We take drugs known as proton pump inhibitors, so we don't make too much acid (protons).\n",
      "Great question. When we eat food the stomach helps break it down but not so much that we end up with elemental carbon in our gut instead of sugars fats and proteins right? So it helps break the food up but doesn't destroy everything like ripping apart protein chains. \n",
      "\n",
      "Food poisoning may usually be caused by bacteria, but it's not a bacterial infection that makes us sick, it's the metabolic byproducts of that bacteria. Take botulism for instance; the bacteria create a poison as they multiply and it's the poison that makes us sick, not the bacteria. That poison ends up deposited in the food and so eating it is literally eating poison. And much the same way the stomach doesn't turn protein into carbon, it doesn't turn poison into carbon, it stays as poison. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even from a bacteria stand point our stomachs don't sterilize the food we eat with acid. Living bacteria makes its way into the gut where it has to compete with the colonies already living there. Along with our own immune system we end up with a good balance of beneficial bacteria with malign invaders not gaining a toehold in our gut. We benefit from this because gut fauna help us digest our food even better and get more nutrients from it than we would without it. \n",
      "I know you probably have more than enough information to answer your question, but I'm just gonna throw in my quickie. \n",
      "\n",
      "When the acidity of your stomach is off balance from what it usually is, it can cause a purge of it's contents in an effort to resume proper pH levels.\n",
      "You get food poisoning by two ways,\n",
      "First the microbes had already made there toxins(poison) outside your body and then you eat that food so you have ate the poison and this will take up to 1-3 hours to get the symptoms.\n",
      "Second you eat the microbes then it makes the toxin(poison) when it is in you gut and this will take longer time to make symptoms .\n",

      "Hi, I'm a second year microbiology student. Microbes are quite a cool bunch with lots of adaptations that make them able to colonise quite a broad spectrum of places. Whilst the stomach is highly acidic, which is generally good enough to kill most microbes that enter the gastrointestinal tract. There are some microbes, such as helicobacter pylori that are able to evade this acidity by secreting neutralising agents, along with burrowing into the stomach cells and hiding in a sense. Other times, the microbes actually don't survive, but their exotoxins (the things they secrete that make us sick or cause injury to our cells) are stable enough to survive their time in the stomach. They then pass through into the intestine where they can cause a range of diarrhoeal diseases. I can't think of any off the top of my head. But hopefully this is helpful.\n",
      "No one is mentioning the fact that the stomach acid *does* kill off a lot of bacteria. You need a certain amount to get past the stomach acid and other factors. See https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_dose for ecoli and salmonella\n",
      "On the flip side, if I think I ate something tainted, and I quaff a few shots of whiskey, will that kill the bacteria in whatever I ate?\n",
      "There is a great [Radiolab episode](http://www.radiolab.org/story/197112-guts/) about Dr. William Beaumont and the experiments he conducted on Aexis St. Martin and the contributions they made to the study of digestion.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I remember correctly, St. Martin had a fistula in his stomach, and Beaumont would drop food in to see what would happen. He noticed pores in the stomach wall lining secreting a liquid that would begin to break the the items down. He also took samples of St. Martin's gastric acid to break food down outside his stomach. Before this, it was thought that digestion was performed by the stomach squeezing and mashing food.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot remember and am not sure Beaumont realized the difference between stomach acid and enzymes, however.\n",
      "Something not mentioned E. Coli is one of the more common reasons people get food poisoning. E. Coli already lives in your gut and helps you digest food. When it senses a new strain is present it can tell your body you are sick to try and kill off competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also some bacteria and microbes can form little shells around themselves to help them scoot through the acid section.\n",
      "Meat curer hobbyist here. There are two things going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stomach acid does kill bacteria. But it kills only a percentage and mostly, it prevents it from growing. If the infection is high enough, or the bacterium is resistant to acid, it will still grow. Iirc, salmonella will infect you if you get more than about 110 cells per gram of food. E coli can infect you with only a few cells! Some acid tolerant bacteria are beneficial or harmless, such as lactobacillus. So the amount of infection you eat, along with how dangerous the bacterium is matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there's another process at work, too, most notable with botulism and other bacteria and fungi (Aspergillus flavus, e.g.). **The bacteria doesn't need to be alive, and the byproducts are what's dangerous.** It's not an infection, but rather, the toxins they leave when they're alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is why cooking food that's gone bad is not proof against getting sick. It works for many things, but definitely not all.\n",
      "There are certain bacteria that are more easily destroyed by the stomach when its acid production is at full capacity.  Clostridium difficile is one, and people taking acid suppressors appear to be at greater risk of having C. diff colonize their gut, especially in a hospital setting.  \n",
      "Maybe this isn't what was being asked, but we often get sick from microbes, especially viruses such as influenza, that cause infections in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. The infection starts in your nose or throat before the microbe would even come in contact with stomach acid. The term \"stomach flu\" is a bit of a misnomer as a viral infection starting in the stomach wouldn't be caused by influenza, but could be from other viruses, which I think has been covered in prior responses.\n",
      "The bugs/chemicals that do end up making us sick are the ones capable of bypassing this acidic barrier. The few who are able to do so are able to make us sick by two main reasons; they irritate the stomach lining by attacking the cells that make it up, which leads to an immune system response in a part of the brain called the chemoreceptor trigger zone, causing nausea/vomiting to remove the toxins from the stomach.\n",
      "Chemist here. I wanted to point out something that I don't know if has been said. Not a big thing, just a detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stomach, even full of acid, cannot dissolve many things. Something is dissolved by acids if has alkaline character. For example, if you eat limestone (which is alkaline), the acid will break is quickly. But if you eat glass, which is acidic, the acid won’t do anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the amide bonds in proteins can be attacked by acids, but only slowly. That's why the body uses enzymes to speed things up. But it can happen that many toxic compounds have acidic character and won't be affected by the acid, and some bacteria might have protective compounds on the cell surface that don't react with acids, working as a barrier.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is another reason why getting sick can happen. Everything everybody else said is also true. But this is a reason why, for example, hydrogen cyanide can hurt you (is an acid, son the acid in the stomach won't destroy it). In fact, you usually eat the salt, sodium/potassium cyanide. And it is when it founds the acid in the stomach it gets converted to the poisonous hydrogen cyanide. So in that example the stomach acid is part of its toxicity.\n",
      "Two main reasons stand out for me. The first is that many of the bacterial/microbial molecules which make us sick are glycosylated (decorated with sugars) which make sensitive areas resistant to acidic and enzymatic breakdown. The second example is that H. pylori which resides in your stomach takes advantage of the gradient of acidity in your stomach. The lumen (open area further from the lining in contact with food) is most acidic (though not always! Depending on what you eat/drink, the pH of your stomach can be pH 6, or slightly acidic) followed by a gradient of acidity through the protective mucus lining, finally reaching pH 7 (neutral) at the cell lining. So H. pylori will attach to epithelial cells at pH 7, and will sense when the cells have been released into the lumen by sensing the pH, letting go and swimming back toward the pH 7 environment.\n",
      "Things don't get \"destroyed\" by your stomach acid. It merely gets broken down to the collection of molecules that will then be absorbed by your body (or excreted). That being said, things that poison you usually do so because they have a detrimental effect on your body (often, primarily on the liver or brain). These things will typically still be absorbed and, once they are, you become ill. I am speaking in terms of man-made poisons, by the way. Microorganisms and viruses are a whole different story.\n",
      "So just to make sure your food is safely digested before reaching your intestines, is there a specific eating order to risky foods? Like should I eat my chicken before my potatoes? just to make sure it get's thoroughly digested? or would eating smaller amounts of food result in a lower chance of dangerous bacteria reaching my intestines?\n",

      "I've heard the stomach empties within about 2 hours or something, so is there kind of a maximum volume of food that it can properly break up in that time which may or may not be modulated by how much I chew? And so if I over-eat on that metric, I just won't be able to fully or efficiently absorb all of the nutrition from that food?\n",

      "Because we don't just get sick from the micro-organisms, we also get sick from the toxins that the bacteria/viruses produce. Those toxins will linger on even if the bacteria is killed. This is why food that has been left out too long can still make you sick even if you heat it up enough to kill bacteria in it.\n",

Although I saw most of the \"movie\" through the lens of an imaginary camera, I actually embodied Jet Li for some of the major fight scenes.

A squad of F-15 fighter jets scrambled out of the floating palace, making it suddenly clear that George W Bush and Dick Cheney were the bad guys in the floating palace, planning some sort of coupe which would make them divine Emperor-like figures.  If memory serves me correctly, George W Bush was verbally belittled by Dick Cheney and removed from the plot after Jet Li got to the palace, but the final fight scene made up for it, as Dick Cheney had a \"power pole\" just like the one Goku has in Dragon Ball and he knew how to use it.

I'm not sure how likely that is though, we had a blackout at home a few months ago and I was worried about all the stuff in the fridge. So long as the doors are still closed though, fridges can hold the cold for a while with no power and there's usually not much danger unless it's been longer than 8 hours from what I've been told. \n",
